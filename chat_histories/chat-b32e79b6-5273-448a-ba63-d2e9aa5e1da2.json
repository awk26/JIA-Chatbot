    "message": "what is the transfer policy for employee",
    "response": "The company may transfer employees to any department/division of the company/associated companies or anywhere in India/overseas at management's discretion.  This applies to all full-time employees transferred due to hiring, internal job posting, or a new role.  Employees are subject to the practices, working hours, and holidays of the new location/unit.  Intercompany transfers require the relieving company to complete the exit process and the receiving company to complete onboarding.  The relieving entity transfers statutory benefits (PF, Leaves & Gratuity).  Intracompany transfers receive a transfer letter; intercompany transfers receive a new appointment letter.  The company uses a group service certificate to capture the employee's entire tenure if they leave after a transfer; units do not provide experience certificates for intracompany transfers. The receiving company covers relocation costs for 7 days from the employee's departure from the previous entity.  The company endeavors to ensure employees do not lose gross emoluments in a transfer, but management may disallow reimbursements deemed unreasonable.  Management may amend/alter the transfer policy at any time.  Employee-initiated transfers require notification to the supervisor and entity HR; fulfillment depends on vacancy in the requested location; the new location head may interview the employee; and the employee must adhere to the new location's practices, working hours, and holidays.  The Head of HR & Admin issues the transfer order.",

    "response": "Based on the provided text, there are multiple policies related to backups.  The main policies are:\n\n* **Network Security Policy (v1.1):** This policy outlines responsibilities for backup system configuration, scheduling, restoration, media management, log reviews, and offsite backup processes.  It assigns responsibility to the IT Administrator.\n\n* **Data Backup Restore Policy (v1.2):** This policy details procedures for external media backups, ad-hoc backups, event-based backups, media handling, offsite storage, media rotation, restoration drills, and assigning responsibilities (including HOD IT for desktops/laptops).\n\n* **Acceptable Use Policy (v1.2):** This policy states that IT ensures backups for most systems, but employees are responsible for backing up their local data on PCs/laptops using a centralized tool provided by the IT team.  It also emphasizes the need for periodic backups, testing recovery, and contacting IT for assistance.",

    "response": "To avoid virus infection or data theft, avoid opening attachments and clicking links unless the content is adequately explained. Be suspicious of clickbait titles. Check email addresses and sender names for legitimacy. Look for inconsistencies like grammar mistakes, excessive capitalization, or exclamation marks. If unsure about an email's safety, refer to the IT cell.  All emails are scanned for security threats (spam, phishing, spear phishing, business email compromise, etc.).",

    "response": "The media handling process covers access, movement, handling, storage, and movement of media, including onsite and offsite processes, testing, and restoration.  Backup media should not be exposed to excessive heat, light, moisture, dust, high magnetic fields, or static electricity.  CDs/DVDs should be protected from scratches, and hard disks from mechanical jerks or vibrations. Antistatic packaging should be used for tapes and hard disks during transport.  A courier agreement with clear handling instructions and a preferred courier should be in place. If a third-party facility is used, a list of personnel involved from both the company and the service provider must be maintained. The transfer periodicity and mode are determined by JMBGRP and adhered to by the service provider. If handled in-house, the IT Administrator assigns a team member.",
