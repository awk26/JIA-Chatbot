    "response": "The leave policy covers Sick Leave, Annual Leave, and other unspecified leave types (SPL/ML).  Leave is not a right, and approval from the Competent Authority is required.  All leaves exclude weekly offs and paid holidays unless otherwise specified. Sick Leave and Annual Leave can be combined with Maternity Leave, but only after Maternity Leave, Sick Leave, and Annual Leave are exhausted in that order.  Upon transfer to another group company, leave balances are carried forward.  Up to 30 days of unavailed Annual Leave can be encashed upon full and final settlement (retirement/death). The policy is effective from December 1st, 2020, except for Optional Leave, which is effective from April 1st, 2021.  Unauthorized absence is considered serious misconduct.  The management can amend, modify, revise, or withdraw the policy at any time without notice.",
