    "message": "what is the transfer policy for employee",
    "response": "The company may transfer employees to any department/division of the company/associated companies or anywhere in India/overseas at management's discretion.  This applies to all full-time employees transferred due to hiring, internal job posting, or a new role.  Employees are subject to the practices, working hours, and holidays of the new location/unit.  Intercompany transfers require the relieving company to complete the exit process and the receiving company to complete onboarding.  The relieving entity transfers statutory benefits (PF, Leaves & Gratuity).  Intracompany transfers receive a transfer letter; intercompany transfers receive a new appointment letter.  The company uses a group service certificate to capture the employee's entire tenure if they leave after a transfer; units do not provide experience certificates for intracompany transfers. The receiving company covers relocation costs for 7 days from the employee's departure from the previous entity.  The company endeavors to ensure employees do not lose gross emoluments in a transfer, but management may disallow reimbursements deemed unreasonable.  Management may amend/alter the transfer policy at any time.  Employee-initiated transfers require notification to the supervisor and entity HR; fulfillment depends on vacancy in the requested location; the new location head may interview the employee; and the employee must adhere to the new location's practices, working hours, and holidays.  The Head of HR & Admin issues the transfer order.",
