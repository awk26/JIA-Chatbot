    "message": "what is the transfer policy for employee",
    "response": "The company may transfer employees to any department, division, or location in India or overseas at its discretion.  This applies to all full-time employees transferred due to hiring, internal job postings, or new roles.  Employees are subject to the practices, working hours, and holidays of their new location.  Intercompany transfers require the previous company to complete the exit process and the new company to complete onboarding.  Statutory benefits (PF, Leaves, Gratuity) will be transferred by the previous company.  Intracompany transfers receive a transfer letter; intercompany transfers receive a new appointment letter.  The receiving company covers relocation costs for 7 days from the employee's departure from the previous entity.  If an employee leaves after a transfer, a group service certificate will be issued; units will not provide experience certificates for intracompany transfers.  Employee-initiated transfers require notification of the supervisor and entity HR.  The transfer will be fulfilled if a position is available in the requested location.  The new location's head may interview the employee.  The company strives to ensure employees do not lose gross emoluments, but management may disallow unreasonable reimbursements and can amend the transfer policy at any time.  The Head of HR & Admin issues transfer orders.",
