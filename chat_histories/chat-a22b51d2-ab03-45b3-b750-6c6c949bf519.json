    "message": "Is there any policy for maternal leave?",
    "response": "Yes, every female employee is entitled to maternity leave as per the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act 1961.  The leave is up to 26 weeks for the first two children (8 weeks before and 18 weeks after the expected delivery date), or 12 weeks (6 weeks before and 6 weeks after) for women with 2 or more surviving children.  Twelve weeks of leave is also available for adoption of a child up to 3 months old.  Six weeks of leave is provided for miscarriage with a doctor's certificate.  To qualify, an employee must work a minimum of 80 days in the 12 months before the expected delivery date, and apply at least 8 weeks before the expected due date with a gynecologist's certificate.  The policy does not apply if the employee is covered under the ESI scheme; in that case, the ESI Act 1948 applies.  All leaves under the Maternity Benefits Act are inclusive of weekly offs and paid holidays.",
