    "message": "what is the transfer policy for employee",
    "response": "The company may transfer employees to any department/division of the company/associated companies or anywhere in India/overseas at the management's discretion.  This applies to all full-time employees transferred due to hiring, internal job posting, or a new role.  Employees are subject to the practices, working hours, and holidays of the new location/unit.  For intercompany transfers, the previous company handles the exit process, and the new company handles onboarding.  Statutory benefits (PF, Leaves, Gratuity) are transferred by the previous entity.  Intracompany transfers receive a transfer letter; intercompany transfers receive a new appointment letter.  The company uses a group service certificate to record the employee's tenure if they leave after a transfer; units do not provide experience certificates for intracompany transfers.  The receiving company covers relocation costs for 7 days from the employee's departure from the previous entity.  The company endeavors to ensure employees do not lose gross emoluments in a transfer, but management may disallow reimbursements deemed unreasonable.  Management may amend/alter the transfer policy at any time.  Employee-initiated transfers require notification to the supervisor and entity HR; they are fulfilled if a relevant position is vacant in the requested location; the employee may be interviewed; and the employee must adhere to the new location's practices, working hours, and holidays.",
